# <PREWORK STUDY GUIDE APPLICATION>

## Description

This study guide was created for students doing the prework to learn how to build a simple web application by using HTML and linking CSS file and a JavaScript file. It contains notes to help them during the bootcamp. 

The coding bootcamp is starting next week and I wanted to come prepared. I completed this prework study guide to help me become familiar with the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I also wanted to set up my account, practise saving my work to Github by using commit, pull, push and merging branches so I had some practise and a basic understanding when class started. 
I can look back at the prework if I need to know how to complete any of the steps I've learned and add more notes to the study guide along the way as I gain more knowledge during the bootcamp.
